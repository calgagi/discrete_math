    \subsection{What is discrete mathematics?}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Discrete math is a very broad umbrella of math that includes combinatorics, graph theory, number theory, etc.
    \end{itemize}

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The number of handshakes that take place will be 9 * 5 = 45 since everyone has to do 9 handshakes, and there are 10/2 handshakes per round.
            \item Zeno ate 1 + (25 * 2) = 51 hot dogs. The number of hot dogs ate in total would be:
            \begin{equation}
                1 + \sum_{n=1}^{25} 2n
            \end{equation}
            This is equal to 25*(25+1)*2 / 2 = 25*26 = 650 hot dogs. I used arithmetic series to calculate: \begin{equation}\sum_{i=1}^{n} i=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\end{equation}
            \item We should open the second box since we know only one box is telling the truth, and if the first chest is telling the truth, then the second chest must be telling the truth. This is a contradiction.
            \item Yes, I believe so. When drawing the picture, I think you can draw roads between all five cities.
